# Gameplay Ability System Example

An example project for setting up the Unreal Engine 4 Gameplay Ability System.

The goal of this project is to show how to setup the Gameplay Ability System in Unreal Engine 4, as well as show examples of abilities.  

If you have an ability you would like to add, feel free to submit a PR with the working ability added (C++ and Blueprint abilities are both fine).
